# Money Tracker Web Application
As part of the Full-Stack Web Development Internship with Bharat Intern, I have completed my 2nd task. Welcome to the Money Tracker Web Application Repository! This project showcases a comprehensive yet user-friendly money-tracking system developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

# Features:
1. Expense Categories: Users can categorize their expenses into different categories for better organization.
2. Budget Management: Set budgets for different expense categories and monitor spending against these budgets.
3. Data Security: All user data is securely stored in a MongoDB database with encrypted connections.
4. Form Validation: Stringent validation checks ensure data integrity and accuracy during user input.

# Folder Structure:
1. HTML: Contains HTML files defining the structure of web pages (e.g., index.html, dashboard.html).
2. CSS: Custom CSS stylesheets for enhancing the visual presentation and layout of the application.
3. js: Client-side JavaScript code responsible for form validation, user interaction, and data visualization.
4. public: Stores static assets such as images and background files to enrich the user interface.
5. server.js: Entry point for the Node.js server application, orchestrating routing and database interactions.
6. package.json: Configuration file listing project dependencies for seamless setup and execution.
7. Feel free to explore and contribute to this money-tracking system to make managing finances a breeze!
